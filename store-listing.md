KeepKnown: Filter Unknown Senders & Whitelist Contacts

## Short Description (132 characters)
Automatically move unknown emails to a specific folder. Only emails from Contacts stay in your Inbox. Never delete, just organize.

## Long Description

Stop digging through noise. Start closing deals.

KeepKnown transforms Gmail into a focused workspace by automatically filtering emails based on your address book.

**How it works:**

✅ **Inbox = VIPs Only:** Emails from your Google Contacts land directly in your Primary Inbox.

📂 **"Outsiders" Folder:** Everyone else (newsletters, cold outreach, unknown senders) is automatically moved to a separate folder.

🛡️ **Zero Data Loss:** We never delete or block emails. We simply move them so you can check them on your schedule.

**Why Top Real Estate Teams use KeepKnown:**

• **Never miss a client:** Your inbox becomes a dedicated channel for active deals.

• **End "Notification Fatigue":** Stop getting pinged by vendor spam on your phone.

• **Safe Alternative:** The privacy-first alternative to Gated.com.

Regain control of your time. Switch Gmail to Contacts Mode.
